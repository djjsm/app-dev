###  Favorite Movie/Series 

**Favorite Series**

1. **Arcane(Netflix Series)**
   *Based on the world behind League of Legends, Arcane dives into the delicate balance between the rich, utopian city of Piltover Crest icon Piltover and the seedy, oppressed underground of Zaun Crest icon Zaun. Known across Runeterra as the "city of progress," many of the most brilliant minds call these cities home. But the creation of hextech, a way for any person to control magical energy, threatens that balance. The story follows the origins of two iconic League champions-and the power that will tear them apart. Like the game on which it is based, Arcane is aimed at a "16+" audience and will deal with some more adult subject matter.*
2. **Dexter**
   *Dexter Morgan is a Miami-based blood splatter expert who doesn't just solve murders; he commits them too. In fact, he's a serial killer  but he only murders the guilty, so he feels justified with his lifestyle choices. His policewoman sister and his cop co-workers have no idea Dexter lives a double life; however, adoptive father Harry knows his secret, and does, in fact, help Dexter hone his "skills." It's a unique brand of justice for which charming Dexter feels a psychological hunger.*
3. **Partners of Justice**
   *About a forensic doctor, Baek Beom, who is skillful at his work but has an eccentric personality, and prosecutor, Eun Sol, who is a rookie prosecutor with a warm heart. She has a bright personality and comes from a wealthy family background. They come to work together to solve cases.*
